##rockpack-iOS

This is the iOS client for RockPad.  This is currently designed as an iPad only (non-universal) app, with built in media to showcase the UI.  

This will evolve into a universal app capable of supporting iPhone and iPod touch devices and will access media from the RockPack and 3rd party servers.
