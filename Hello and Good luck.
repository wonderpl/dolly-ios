Hello and Good luck. 

View Controllers.

The app has 6 main views. All files can be found in the "View Controllers" Directory.

Discover 
- SYNDiscoverViewController

The IPad has a container view called SYNSearchResultsViewController that contains 
the serach results.

Feed 
- SYNFeedRootViewController
	- SYNIPadFeedRootViewController
	- SYNIPhoneFeedRootViewController

The 2 sub classes are for the layout logic and for the naming of the reuse cells 

Profile 
- SYNProfileViewController

SYNProfileViewController is the main VC. It is the container for 3 other VC's

- SYNProfileSubscriptionViewController
- SYNProfileVideoViewController
- SYNProfileChannelViewController

Each of these VC's have a seperate collectionview.

Activity
- SYNActivityViewController

Video Player Overlay
 - SYNVideoPlayerViewController
 	SYNVideoPlayerViewController has a container underneath the videoplayer called
 	SYNVideoInfoViewController. 

The videoplayer is currently in a UICollectionView. There have been issues with this with Reuse. To solve this problem there is always 
a stored SYNVideoPlayer for the current video. The videoplayer is set in setSelectedIndex. 

Network calls.

- SYNAbstractNetworkEngine
	- SYNNetworkEngine - Http
	- SYNOAuthNetworkEngine - Https


Overall view controller archetecture of the app.

The app is contained in SYNMasterViewController. 
SYNMasterViewController handles the top level navigation. (Tab bars).
Navigation is all handled in SYNNavigationManager.
Within the MasterViewController it has a container called SYNContainerViewController.
SYNContainerViewController initilises all the VC's. 

Data model 

The core data stack is initilised in the appDelegate method -(void) initializeCoreDataStack.

There are 3 registerys to save to core data.
 -SYNSearchRegistery
	Search registry never clears its entries upon registry because the data is always considered fresh. It is the controllers responsibility to clear it when needed
	The search PersistentStoreCoordinator is NSInMemoryStoreType, It is for search so its not somthing that is required to be stored persistently. 


SYNPagingModel
All list data should be using this class. An example can be seen in 
SYNProfileVideoViewController - SYNProfileVideoModel
